PyFaps 
------

Automated high throughput structure adsorption analysis and library of
python methods for customising simulations.

Installation
============

Untar the package somewhere and put a link to help.py or a symlink in
your path. Edit 'site.ini' in the installation directory to customize
all simulations for the machine you will be running on (an example file
is included)

Running
=======

Simulation requires a structure (currently accepts a .pdb). Executing
the script in the working directory of the structure will try to
automatically run all steps for a complete analysis.

Disclaimer
==========

This software is still pre-alpha stage. There will be serious bugs. The
interfaces will change and break backwards and forward compatibility.
Keep your simulation outputs so that you can reimport them at a later
time.
