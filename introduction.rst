A code for Fully Automated Adsorption Analysis in Porous Solids
---------------------------------------------------------------


Faps is a tool to aid in the simulation of sorption properties of nanoporous
materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOF). From a user perspective
it has been designed to automate the process from input of the initial structure
file to generation of isotherms and various other properties by abstracting the
interaction between different molecular simulation packages. On a more
fundamental level it provides a base for development of custom multi-part
simulation and can be subclassed into a diverse range of applications.

It is recommended that new users read the quickstart tutorial and refer to this
documentation for details of all the available options.
