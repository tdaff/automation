niss_to_cif.py

Extract the structure from running or finished faps simulataions. Will process
multiple jobs when given together on the commandline. This script will read in
the state of the simulation from the niss file and create a cif with the latest
optimised structure including the most recent charges.

Usage: niss_to_cif.py JOB_NAME1 [JOB_NAME2] [...]

Options:
  -h, --help         print this help and exit
