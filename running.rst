============
Running faps
============

To run faps issue the command `faps $JOBNAME`. A structure file (.pdb or some
.cif) is required and optionally an input file if you wish to change any
program options.

On `wooki` the job will stop after each step and can be continued by re-issuing
the command. Jobs on `orca` will run to completion by default.
