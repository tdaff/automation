faps 
----

Automated high throughput structure adsorption analysis and library of
python code for further customising simulations.

This code is the property of the Woo Lab and should not be used without
contacting a member of the lab first.

Documentation
=============

Complete documentation can be found in the faps-doc package. If this has
been installed on your machine it may be available with a `faps-doc` or
`faps-man` command.

Installation
============

Obtain a copy of the package, put it somewhere and make a link to
faps.py in your $PATH. Edit 'site.ini' in the installation directory to
customize all simulations for the machine you will be running on (an
example file is included).

Running
=======

Simulations require a structure. Executing the script in the working
directory of the structure will try to automatically run all steps for a
complete analysis.

Disclaimer
==========

This software is still in beta-ish stage. There will be numerous bugs
and missing features; interfaces will change and break backwards and
forward compatibility.  Keep your simulation outputs so that you can try
to reimport them at a later time.
