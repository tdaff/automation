Fapswitch
=========

Fapswitch is an extension of the faps Structure class that produces
functionalised structures with or without symmetry constraints.

-----
Input
-----

Fapswitch works best with a CIF that contains the asymmetric unit and all the
symmetry operations.

A library of functional groups is included. These can be added to or overridden
by placing supplementary groups in a 'functional_groups.lib' file in the user's
`~/.faps` directory or in the working directory.
